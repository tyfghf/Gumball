# Gumball, GameEngine, GameLibrary

Gumball Objective:
Make a "GameEngine" that give the programmer all the access for exploring and build new ideias;

Gumball heading Rules:
-be 2d and 3d;
-possibility to load assets(textures, shaders, meshes, sounds)
-support c++, lua, python, js and C#;
-contain physics;
-support for network;
-editorTime/engineTime Scripts, runtime Scripts;
-contain a default editorUI, the hooks for bind an UIEditor must be public(sdk) so anyone can create his own editor;
-the workflow cannot be too strange or wierd in base what we have now in the market(ue4, unity);
-the programmer must have all the access, thus exploring the morphology of code and experimenting. DON'T BE RELIGIOUS, make some multiple inheritance, functionPointers, get the memory by force. 
-all core files inline (.hpp or .h) because c++ linker are annoying, engine core build should generate a library.

Be awesome:
"dont let good ideias spoil good work"-Bjarne Stroustrup.
"[...] value is not equal to work hour [...]"-StarShip troopers.

Programmers can create almost anything dont let concepts or ideias slow your creational process.
Have some fun \o/
